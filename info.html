					<h3>When did you first become interested in the arts?</h3>
	           <p>My love affair with the arts began at very early age thanks to my artist/musician mom. I'll never forget winning my first blue ribbon at a local art fair when I was in kindergarten. My parents also started me on piano lessons around that time—after which my poor siblings had to endure my sometimes endless practice until I was a teen.</p>
				</div>

					<h3>What got you into making things on the computer?</h3>
	           <p>It’s a little embarrassing, but when I was 12 I got addicted to an online game where you could own horses and enter them into shows. One feature I loved was the option to add a custom picture to represent your horse—I used Photoshop to make collage-like designs for my horses. Soon after that other people started asking me to make them designs also. As demand grew, I began to charge a pretty penny for it. Before I knew it, I was one of the richest players in the game. It was then that I hacked together my first website to sell my services.</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Cool, so you made a bunch of fake money when you were a kid. What about the real stuff?</h3>
	           <p>My parents had a graphic design business—which was the reason I had access to design software in the first place. They coached me through small design jobs like brochures and signage. My first work that got published was a sign I made for a kennel when I was 13. It featured an illustration of a St. Bernard I created using Photoshop and Illustrator.

					<h3>When you found digital art, did you move away from traditional methods?</h3>
	           <p>Yes, I mostly put away the paintbrushes until my sophomore year of high school, when I moved from Connecticut to Arizona. After that my attention drifted back to traditional art. I lived in the art room while learning printmaking, pottery, sculpting and painting techniques. I took my first graphic design class as a senior in high school, which is when I decided I wanted a career in design. I still use colored pencils, watercolor and acrylics in addition to digital programs to create my illustrations.</p>

					<h3>What did you study in college?</h3>
	           <p>Although my diploma says I have a Bachelor of Science in Humanities from Northern Arizona University, most of my classes were in digital arts and web design. Their 90/30 program was perfect for me since I worked full-time (sometimes 3 jobs at a time!). I got great training from dedicated professors who pushed me to do some of my best work. One professor nominated me for the Stickell Internship by the American Advertising Federation (AAF). I was one of 20 students chosen from around the country to win the internship, and the only student to be placed at the New York Times. </p>

					<h3>Where did the name “Lestrella” come from?</h3>
	           <p>Lestrella (pronounced “les-trell-ah”), is the name I’ve used to identify myself on the web since I started using the internet. Estrella means star in Spanish, and I've always liked how the name Ella sounds. I added an L to estrella and made it my own.</p>

					<h3>What kind of work experience have you had so far?</h3>
	           <p>In addition to my internships at Pacific Cornetta and the New York Times—I worked full-time at a few start-ups as well as a web design shop before graduating. I also did as many freelance projects as my busy schedule would allow, mostly logo design, web design and development projects. At my most recent job as a Senior Designer for a tech start-up in NYC, I designed for many top brands including Audi, H&#38;M, Walgreens, American Express and more. I left there after about a year to go freelance.</p>

					<h3>What are you working on now?</h3>
	           <p>I freelance for a variety of companies including Chloe &#38; Isabel, Carol’s Daughter and The Cools. I also work with individuals and businesses to create their logo, website, marketing materials and more. At night time I like to paint, draw and illustrate whatever ideas are floating around in my head.</p>

	           <p>Yes, please send any inqueries to mthayer@lestrella.com.</p>

					<h3>What inspires you?</h3>
	           <p>Music, music, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/michellekthayer/likes" target="_blank">music!</a> It accompanies me through most of the stages of my design process. A toned-down minimal, deep or progressive set is perfect when I'm brainstorming. A jazzy house set <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bloes-brothers/bloes-brothers-4-bakermat" target="_blank">like this one</a> by Bakermat really gets me flowing when I'm executing my ideas. Patterns found in nature are the ultimate design and a constant source of inspiration for my own work. I'm also an avid appreciator of architecture with a special fascination in the relationship between architecture and music. Studying the work of Iannis Xenakis expanded my world significantly by showing me that music can inspire designs more deliberately than just on a subconscious level.  </p>

					<h3>What do you specialize in?</h3>
	           <p>I specialize in logo design, graphic design, web design, and illustration. I know enough about front-end development to put together a website (I like HAML &#38; SASS). I’m also generally knowledgeable about UI design and UX design.</p>
				</div>
				
			  <div class="objects">
					<h3>What do you do when you're not working?</h3>
	           <p>I live in NYC so of course I take full advantage of the underground music scene here. Some favorite parties include Lee Burridge's All Day I Dream, Mister Sunday and the occasional Verboten gig. </p><p>I counterbalance going out with yoga, running and working out. Right now I'm doing a self-directed studio tour of the best yoga studios in NYC. My favorite studio so far has <a href="http://stralayoga.com/" target="_blank">Strala Yoga</a> in Soho. It's such a happy and warm environment! Every instructor seriously knows their stuff, but aren't pretentious about it.</p>
	<p>Traveling, exploring and reading are my other loves. My interests go on and on as I'm always trying new things, but those are the things that take up most of my free time.</p>

					<h3>What are some of your favorite books</h3>
	           <p>Paulo Coehlo's books resonate with me more so than any other authors. I've read all of his books and enjoyed “The Winner Stands Alone,” “Eleven Minutes” and “Zahir” the most. I never liked poetry until I started reading Hafiz. Now I love reading the poems of Pablo Neruda, Rumi and Hafiz. Other books I'd recommend are “Kite Runner,” “Forty Rules of Love,” and “Little Bee.”</p>
